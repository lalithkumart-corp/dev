For SSL config..

1. 	cd "C:\Apache24\bin"
2.	set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\Apache24\conf\openssl.cnf
3.	openssl req -new -out server.csr
		Inputs i provided::
			passphrase = 'pass'
			common name = 'workspace'
			country name = 'IN'
			state = 'TN'
			Locality = 'chennai'
			org name = 'Lalith company'
			Common Name = 'workspace'  	//this is where we need to enter out Domain Name
			Email addr = 'lalithkmr9@gmail.com'
			pwd = 'kforkitesan.'
4.	openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
		Inputs i have provided::
			pass phrase = 'pass'
5.	openssl x509 -in server.csr -out server.cert -req -signkey server.key -days 365
		//Expiry date can be our wish. I have just given for 365 days

Now We need to MOVE the "server.cert" and "server.key" and "server.csr" file to the "C:\Program Files\Apache24\conf" location.
Goto httpd.conf, and enable these two lines

	LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
	Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

Goto https-ssl.conf, and enable two lines with proper file name(recently created ssl key certificate files)

	SSLCertificateFile "c:/Apache24/conf/server.cert"
	SSLCertificateKeyFile "c:/Apache24/conf/server.key"

And in same file (httpd-ssl.conf), just add '*' in vitual host header (only if ssl apache restart thows error), (LINE NO: 121)
	<VirtualHost *:443>
Restart apache

For Sql: 04/09/2016
1. Install MySql server (say MySql server 5.5)
	On Installing, go with default options that will later prompts you with configuration popups.
	The configurations will also prompts you with password and all....(i have set password as 'root')
	If you decline to set password, then No password will be set. You can set password in Server client too.
	
	I have added the server installation file it into my Drive.
2. Install sql client like Workbench
	The workbench will automatically detect the local server and shows you server connection in its display home page. Click on it, and enter Password(if Set)
